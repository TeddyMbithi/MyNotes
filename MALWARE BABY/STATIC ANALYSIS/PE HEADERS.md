1. Open up PE-bear.
2. Load the executable -> file, Load PEs
3. Also drop file into PEAnatomist that can
		- Get Timestamp and others at the File Header section.

- MZ on the blue screen or (4D 5A) on the white sheet indicates its an exe file. 
- All necessary information is on the main screen including all header, imports, resources and Debug info
- If the size of the raw data is almost equal to the raw size(IMAGE_SECTION_HEADER .text) then it is not a packed binary.
- A **packed binary** is a normal Windows PE executable (.exe, .dll, .sys, etc.) that has been **compressed or encrypted** by a special tool called a **packer** (or **crypter/protector**).

When you run a packed binary, this happens:

1. The packed file is very small or looks like random/garbage data.
2. At runtime, a small piece of code (the **stub** or **unpacking stub**) executes first.
3. This stub **decompresses or decrypts** the real original program in memory.
4. The stub then jumps to the real program’s original entry point (OEP) and the malware runs normally.
